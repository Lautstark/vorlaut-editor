/* What the vendored recording chain does, checked against something that is
 * not itself.
 *
 *     node tests/browser/level.test.mjs
 *
 * Run by tests/test_browser_level.py, so `python3 tests/run.py` includes it.
 *
 * There is already a test next to this one - tests/test_browser_tts.py - and
 * it reads the constants out of level.js and compares them with tts.py. That
 * is worth having and it is not this. Constants can all be right while the
 * arithmetic between them is wrong, and that test would pass; it never runs a
 * line of JavaScript.
 *
 * This one runs the module. The hard part is not running it, though - it is
 * finding anything to compare the answer with. Almost everything here could
 * be measured with integratedLufs(), and integratedLufs() is what decided the
 * gain in the first place, so a wrong implementation would satisfy every
 * check that used it. That is exactly how the sibling project's browser audio
 * tests turned out to be circular, discovered only once its Python half was
 * being deleted.
 *
 * So the numbers below came from outside. tools/ttsfreeze.py measured them
 * with the real ffmpeg, and where a whole recording is involved it put that
 * recording through tts.py - the chain this file is a port of - and measured
 * the result. tests/reference/tts.lock.json is what it wrote down, along with
 * what produced it and what would invalidate it.
 *
 * If a check here fails, the fault is in level.js. Do not regenerate the lock
 * file to make it pass: that turns the one external opinion in this repository
 * back into a mirror, which is the thing it was built to stop.
