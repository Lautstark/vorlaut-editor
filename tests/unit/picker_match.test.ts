/* Telling a hit from a near miss.
 *
 * A search that finds nothing has said so for a long time. A search that finds
 * the wrong thing looked exactly like one that found the right thing: twelve
 * tiles, every one of them confident. "nicht" in METACOM is the case that
 * showed it - every hit a rendering of "nichtbinaer", because METACOM has no
 * "nicht" symbol and never will, and nothing on the screen said so.
 *
 * What is under test is the line, not the ranking: bildquelle grades the hits
 * and vorlaut reads the grade. So the collections here are real providers
 * answering real searches - a fabricated score would pass whatever the reading
 * was, including a reading of a number bildquelle no longer produces.
 *
 * Both sources, and that is the point of the file. ARASAAC does not hand back
 * the ladder score: it hands back the ladder plus a preference for pictograms
 * drawn for AAC use, and a word-prefix on a flagged pictogram arrives at the
 * same number a whole-word match does. Reading it raw would have caught the
 * METACOM case and missed the identical ARASAAC one.
 *
 * The sentences come out of the table the page reads rather than out of one
 * language's column, because which language a test runner opens in is the
 * host's locale.
