/**
 * This app's dialogs, which are @lautstark/design/dialog's — with its two
 * dismissals named once instead of at every call site.
 *
 * The shared module deliberately carries no words: two of the four products are
 * bilingual and a string in the package would be wrong in one of them. So every
 * caller supplies `cancelLabel` and `closeLabel`, and here that meant
 * t("ui.cancel") five times and t("ui.close") twelve — seventeen chances for one
 * of them to drift, the worst count in the family.
 *
 * bildhaft has had this wrapper since the shared module existed; the other three
 * wrote the labels out. The family review of 2026-09-02 counted them.
 *
 * The two dismissals stay named apart, which is the rule this exists to hold
 * rather than a detail it happens to satisfy: the corner ✕ says what it *is*, a
 * footer button says what it *does*, and giving both the same name is the defect
 * design.md §2 recorded.
 *
 * `t` is called per invocation and never captured: this page changes language
 * without reloading, and a label read once would be the previous language's.
