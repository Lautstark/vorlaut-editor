// The build, written into a folder somebody can see.
//
// The cable is how content reaches a talker, and for as long as it is the only
// way, everything depends on it working the first time it meets hardware. This
// is the other end of that risk: the same files the cable would send, on the
// disk instead, where two other things can reach them.
//
//   - `tools/serialcheck.html` has a directory picker. It is the bench, it is
//     independent of this page, and it can push a folder at a device when the
//     page cannot.
//   - `mklittlefs` turns a directory into a file system image, which `esptool`
//     writes straight into the partition. That path needs no cable protocol at
//     all - it is the one that works when the wire itself is wrong.
//
// So this is not an export in the sense the Daten panel means it, and it is
// deliberately not part of the backup: a build is derived from the board and
// the symbols, and carrying it in a backup would be carrying something that
// can be made again. What cannot be made again by any other means is the
// *shape* - a folder that is byte for byte what the device's file system
// should hold - and that is what this writes.
//
// It does not remember the folder. The standing backup does, because it writes
// unattended and a folder it forgot is a backup that silently stopped. This
// runs when somebody asks it to, before a bench run or an image, so a picker
// each time costs one click and saves a stored handle whose permission can
// lapse without anybody noticing.
