// worth watching, a cancel that has to be able to arrive mid-flight, and a

// The protocol is not here. tools/cable.js is the browser's half of the wire

// drives against the C reader compiled out of the sketch - byte for byte, in
// both directions. A copy of it inside src/ would be a second implementation,
// and the tested one would not be the shipped one. So this file is the part
// that has a browser in it, and that file remains the part that does not.
//
// What is left for here, then, is three things the wire format has no opinion
// about: which port out of the several a laptop has, where the files come
// from, and what the page is told while it happens.
