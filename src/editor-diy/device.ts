// Which talker this page may speak to.
//
// One explicit connect the first time, and silent reconnect for ever after.
// That is what docs/cable.md concluded from the two facts about the browser,
// and it is worth restating here because the interface briefly had a different
// shape and the difference is not cosmetic.
//
// requestPort() needs transient activation and Chrome expires it in about five
// seconds; a build with speech in it takes longer. So a picker opened by the
// button that builds and sends has to come *before* the build - and then
// dismissing that picker has already cost a build nobody asked for, which is
// exactly what it did. A dialog somebody closes should cost nothing.
//
// **So the picker has a button of its own, with no build waiting behind it.**
// That is the whole of the rule, and it survives the two places that button
// has lived. It used to be in the settings sheet, under Device; that panel is
// gone, and the button is the one inside release.ts's transfer sheet now - a
// step somebody is standing on, whose own click is the activation, reached
// before anything has been built. The move changed where the rule is kept, not
// what it says: whoever puts a picker back behind the press that builds will
// rediscover the same lost minutes.
//
// The press that sends never opens a dialog: it uses what getPorts() already
// grants, which needs no gesture at all. This module is what the two share.
